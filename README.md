# AI-Powered-Code-Optimizer
**Optimization Process**
The AI optimizer follows a structured approach:
1. User Inputs Code ‚Äì Users paste their Python script into a Streamlit web app.
2. Performance Measurement (Before Optimization) ‚Äì The performance.py module measures execution time and memory usage.
3. AI Optimization ‚Äì The script is sent to Google‚Äôs Gemini AI for enhancement. The AI refactors the code to improve efficiency while preserving functionality.
4. Performance Measurement (After Optimization) ‚Äì The improved code is evaluated again.
5. Visualization ‚Äì Performance differences are displayed using Matplotlib graphs and Streamlit metrics.
<br/>

**Assumptions and Constraints**

The AI optimization strictly avoids unnecessary complexity (e.g., no replacing simple loops with recursion).
The model does not refactor algorithm logic beyond improving execution/memory performance.
The tool works best with general Python scripts, but optimizations may vary depending on input complexity.
<br/>
<br/>

**How It Works**


1. Web Interface (Streamlit App) <br/>

üìÅFile: app.py

The Streamlit-based web app provides an interactive way for users to paste their Python scripts and receive optimized versions. It also visualizes improvements in execution time and memory usage.

Features: <br/>
‚úÖ Code input area for user scripts<br/>
‚úÖ AI-powered optimization using Google Gemini <br/>
‚úÖ Pre- and post-optimization performance comparison <br/>
‚úÖ Performance visualization using Matplotlib

2. AI-Powered Code Optimization <br/>

üìÅFile: optimizer.py
<br/>

The optimize_code function sends the user‚Äôs script to Google Gemini AI, which generates a more efficient version.

Key Optimization Factors:

‚úÖLoop unrolling and efficiency ‚Äì Reduces redundant operations. <br/>
‚úÖMemory management ‚Äì Improves variable storage and access. <br/>
‚úÖFunction optimizations ‚Äì Reduces unnecessary function calls. <br/>
‚úÖExample Optimized Output: (Consider adding a before/after code snippet screenshot.) <br/>

3. Performance Measurement <br/>

üìÅFile: performance.py

Before and after optimization, the tool measures:

Execution Time (in seconds)<br/>
Memory Usage (in MB)<br/>
üìä Graph Showing Performance Comparison (Consider adding a sample Matplotlib graph here.)<br/>

**Results & Accuracy** <br/>

To evaluate the optimizer, a sample script was tested:<br/>

Example Test:  <br/>
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
```

Optimized Code: <br/>
```python
def optimized_bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        last_swap = 0  # Track the last swap position

        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
                last_swap = j  # Update last swap position

        if not swapped:  # If no swaps, the array is sorted
            break

        n = last_swap + 1  # Reduce comparisons based on last swap

    return arr

arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
optimized_bubble_sort(arr)
```

Original Execution Time: 0.00177 sec <br/>
Optimized Execution Time: 0.00031 sec <br/>
Original Memory Usage: 0.1172 MB <br/>
Optimized Memory Usage: 0 MB <br/>
üöÄ Performance Improved by 82.5%!<br/>

**Potential Improvements** <br/>
‚úÖ More Advanced AI Models ‚Äì Integrate models fine-tuned for code optimization, such as OpenAI Codex or specialized ML models. <br/>
‚úÖ Support for More Languages ‚Äì Extend support to C++, Java, or JavaScript. <br/>
‚úÖ User-Defined Constraints ‚Äì Allow users to specify optimization preferences (e.g., prioritize speed over memory). <br/>
‚úÖ IDE Plugin ‚Äì Develop VS Code/PyCharm plugins for real-time AI-powered code suggestions. <br/>
